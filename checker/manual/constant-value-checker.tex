\chapter{Constant Value Checker\label{constant-value-checker}}

The Constant Value Checker is a constant propagation analysis: for
each variable, it determines whether that variable's value can be
known at compile time.

There are two ways to run the Constant Value Checker.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Typically, it is automatically run by another type checker.
When using the Constant Value Checker as part of another checker, the
\code{statically-executable.astub} file in the Constant Value Checker directory must
be passed as a stub file for the checker.
\item
Alternately, you can run just the Constant Value Checker, by
supplying the following command-line options to javac:
\code{-processor org.checkerframework.common.value.ValueChecker -Astubs=statically-executable.astub}
\end{itemize}

\section{Annotations\label{constant-value-checker-annotations}}

The Constant Value Checker uses type annotations to indicate the value of
an expression (Section~\ref{constant-value-checker-type-annotations}), and
it uses method annotations to indicate methods that the Constant Value
Checker can execute at compile time
(Section~\ref{staticallyexecutable-annotation}).


\subsection{Type Annotations\label{constant-value-checker-type-annotations}}

Typically, the programmer does not write any type annotations.  Rather, the
type annotations are inferred by the Constant Value Checker.
The programmer is also permitted to write type annotations.  This is only necessary in
locations where the Constant Value Checker does not infer annotations:  on fields
and method signatures.

There are 4 common type annotations:
\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{BoolVal},
\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{IntVal},
\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{DoubleVal}, and
\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{StringVal}.

Each type annotation takes as an argument a set of values, and its meaning
is that at run time, the expression evaluates to one of the values.  For
example, an expression of type
\<\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{StringVal}("a", "b")> evaluates to
one of the values \<"a">, \<"b">, or \<null>.
The set is limited to 10 entries; if a variable
could be more than 10 different values, the Constant Value
Checker gives up and its type becomes
\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{UnknownVal} instead (except for
\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{IntVal}
, see below)

% \refqualclass{checker/value/qual}{BottomVal}, meaning that the expression
% is dead or always has the value \<null>.

In the case of
\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{IntVal}
with more than 10 possible values, its type becomes
\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{IntRange} instead of
\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{UnknownVal},
which is a type annotation with two integer arguments: \<from> and \<to>.
It means that at run time, the expression only evaluates to a value that
falls into the interval described by the two arguments. For example, an
expression of type \<@IntRange(from = 0, to = 255)> evaluates to a value
that falls between 0 and 255.

The introduction of \<@IntRange> gives more granularity for the propagation
analysis of integer variables while greatly reduces computational
complexity. On the other hand, when the interval denoted by \<@IntRange>
is smaller than or equal to 10, the annotation would be replaced with
\<@IntVal> with the same set of possible values, providing more precise
propagation analysis.

Figure~\ref{fig-value-hierarchy} shows the
subtyping relationship among the type annotations.
For two annotations of the same type, subtypes have a smaller set of
possible values, as also shown in the figure.
Because \<int> can be casted to \<double>, an \<@IntVal> annotation is a
subtype of a \<@DoubleVal> annotation with the same values.

annotations. Qualifiers in gray are used
internally by the type system but should never be written by a
programmer.  On the right are examples of additional subtyping
relationships that depend on the annotations' arguments.}
\label{fig-value-hierarchy}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-value-multivalue} shows how the Constant Value Checker
infers type annotations (using flow-sensitive type qualifier refinement, Section~\ref{type-refinement}).

\begin{figure}
\begin{Verbatim}
public void foo(boolean b) {
    int i = 1;     // i has type:  @IntVal({1}) int
    if (b) {
        i = 2;     // i now has type:  @IntVal({2}) int
    }
                   // i now has type:  @IntVal({1,2}) int
    i = i + 1;     // i now has type:  @IntVal({2,3}) int
}
\end{Verbatim}
\caption{The Constant Value Checker infers different types
  for a variable on different lines of the program.}
\label{fig-value-multivalue}
\end{figure}

It's worth mentioning that the \<@IntRange> annotation is also implemented in
\<android.support.annotation>. Working together with the
\href{https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint.html}{Lint} tool, it
provides basic integer range checkings on fields, parameters, methods and
local variables, preventing annotated targets from out of range assignments.
However, this tool can only handle compile time known values (literals,
basically) and doesn't provide any subtype checkings or propagation analysis
as the Checker Framework do. If your code is already annotated with
\<@android.support.annotation.IntRange>, the Checker Framework would treat
the annotation exactly as if you had written the \<@IntRange> annotation
from the Constant Value Checker.


\subsection{Compile-time execution of expressions\label{staticallyexecutable-annotation}}

Whenever all the operands of an expression are compile-time constants (that
is, their types have constant-value type annotations), the Constant Value
Checker attempts to execute the expression.  This is independent of any
optimizations performed by the compiler and does not affect the code that
is generated.

The Constant Value Checker statically executes operators that do
not throw exceptions (e.g., \<+>, \<->, \code{<\relax<}, \<!=>), and also
calls to methods annotated with
\refqualclass{common/value/qual}{StaticallyExecutable}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{Verbatim}
@StaticallyExecutable @Pure
public int foo(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

public void bar() {
    int a = 5;          // a has type:  @IntVal({5}) int
    int b = 4;          // b has type:  @IntVal({4}) int
    int c = foo(a, b);  // c has type:  @IntVal({9}) int
}
\end{Verbatim}
\caption{The
  \refqualclass{common/value/qual}{StaticallyExecutable} annotation enables
  constant propagation through method calls.}
\label{fig-staticallyexecutable}
\end{figure}

\begin{sloppypar}
A \<@StaticallyExecutable> method must
be \refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{Pure} (side-effect-free and
deterministic).
Additionally, a \<@StaticallyExecutable> method and any method it calls must be on
the classpath for the compiler, because they are reflectively called at
compile-time to perform the constant value analysis. Any standard
library methods (such as those annotated as \<@StaticallyExecutable> in file
\<statically-executable.astub>) will already be on the
classpath.
\end{sloppypar}

\begin{sloppypar}
To use \<@StaticallyExecutable> on methods in your own code, you should
first compile the code without the Constant Value Checker and then add
the location of the resulting \code{.class} files to the
classpath. This can be done by either adding the destination path to
your environment variable \code{CLASSPATH} or by passing the
argument \code{-classpath path/to/class/files} to the call. The latter
would look similar to:
\code{-processor org.checkerframework.common.value.ValueChecker
-Astubs=statically-executable.astub -classpath \$CLASSPATH:\$MY\_PROJECT/build/}
\end{sloppypar}


\section{Warnings\label{value-checker-warnings}}

If the option \code{-AreportEvalWarns} options is used, the Constant Value Checker issues a warning if it cannot load and run, at
compile time, a method marked as \<@StaticallyExecutable>.  If it issues
such a warning, then the return value of the method will be \<@UnknownVal>
instead of being able to be resolved to a specific value annotation.
Some examples of these:

\begin{sloppypar}
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{[class.find.failed] Failed to find class named Test.}

  The checker could not find the class
  specified for resolving a \<@StaticallyExecutable> method. Typically
  this is caused by not providing the path of a class-file needed to
  the classpath.

\item \code{[method.find.failed] Failed to find a method named foo with argument types [@IntVal(3) int]. Treating result as @UnknownVal}

  The checker could not find the method \code{foo(int)} specified for
  resolving a \<@StaticallyExecutable> method, but could find the
  class. This is usually due to providing an outdated version of the
  class-file that does not contain the \<@StaticallyExecutable>
  method.

\item \code{[method.evaluation.exception] Failed to evaluate method public static int Test.foo(int) because it threw an exception: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero. Treating result as @UnknownVal}

  An exception was thrown when trying to statically execute the
  method. In this case it was a divide-by-zero exception. If the
  arguments to the method each only had one value in their annotations
  then this exception will always occur when the program is actually
  run as well. If there are multiple possible values then the exception
  might not be thrown on every execution, depending on the run-time values.

\end{itemize}
\end{sloppypar}

There are some other situations in which the Constant Value Checker produces a
warning message:

\begin{sloppypar}
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{[too.many.values.given] The maximum number of arguments permitted is 10. Remove the annotation. Treating result as @UnknownVal}

  The Constant Value Checker only tracks up to 10 possible values for an
  expression.  If you write an annotation with more values than will be
  tracked, the annotation is replaced with \<@UnknownVal>.

\item \code{[too.many.int.values] The maximum number of integer arguments permitted is 10. Remove the annotation. Treating result as @IntRange to reduce computational complexity}

  Similar to above, but with \<@IntVal> annotations.

\item \code{[too.narrow.int.range] The smallest interval of integer range permitted is 10. Remove the annotation. Treating result as @IntVal to have finer propagation results.}

  Vice versa.

\item \code{[from.greater.than.to] The integer range specified is abnormal. Remove the annotation. Treating result as @UnknownVal}

  Issue a warning when user accidentally confuse \<from> for \<to>.
